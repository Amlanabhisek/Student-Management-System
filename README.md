# Student-Management-System
I have created a Student management system using python  and tkinter GUI.
When you run the student_management_system.py file  for the first time you will get an error.
Because in the first execution student database will create before that  student database  does not present in your system or computer, so it will create a student databse and will throw error.
After the first execution it will execute without error.
